      <p>To find the underlying cause of PCOS, we must understand the nature of this disease.</p>

<p>The common consensus among the scientific community is that women with PCOS have an increased risk of insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.</p>

<p>These conditions are all a manifestation of poor lifestyle choices (overeating and inactivity), but we cannot draw the same conclusion with PCOS by looking only at its associated risks.</p>

<p>Let’s dig into the research and see what other clues we can find. Here are some findings from the most cited studies on PCOS:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Insulin resistance affects 65-70% of women with PCOS.</li>
<li>50% of women with PCOS are overweight or obese.</li>
<li>Both obese and non-obese women with PCOS are more insulin resistant than healthy women.</li>
<li>Women with PCOS have an increased prevalence of obesity.</li>
<li>Fat cells in women with PCOS tend to be more insulin resistant.</li></ul></p>
<p><b><i>And some interesting findings on the genetic side of the issue:</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstrual periods) was more common in the mothers and sisters of women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.</li>
<li>Recent twin and family studies have suggested that insulin resistance is a genetic defect in PCOS.</li></ul>

    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
      <p><b>Throughout these research papers, the one phrase that sticks out most is insulin resistance. It seems that insulin and insulin resistance play the most prominent role in causing PCOS. This means that putting someone with PCOS on a diet that can lower insulin levels and reduce insulin resistance— like the ketogenic diet — is best, right?</b></p>

<p><b>Before we jump to any conclusions, we must also consider the studies on the inheritability of PCOS. The studies found that this disorder has a genetic influence that is independent of lifestyle factor, which raises the question — are women with PCOS stuck with it?</b></p>

    <img src="https://cdn.ruled.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/graphic_pcos-inheritable-yet-mutable.png" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
  <p>Many researchers suggest that there are specific genetic variants that contribute to PCOS. For example, a recent study by Miller and colleagues concluded that we might be able to explain the association of PCOS and insulin resistance by a single genetic defect.</p>

<p>Another group of researchers proposed the theory that fetal adaptations cause the genetic defect(s) that lead(s) to PCOS. In other words, if the fetus is developing inside of its mother while she is in a stressful environment (i.e., lacking adequate food), then the fetus will undergo genetic changes to help it adapt to that stressful environment.</p>

<p>One of these genetic adaptations is insulin resistance. Although insulin resistance is associated with PCOS, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, it is useful when food is scarce because it keeps energy in the blood for a longer duration, so it can reach the cells that need it most.</p>
<p>Scientists theorize that some women develop a particular type of insulin resistance that turns off their fertility cycle and increases their testosterone levels to improve their chances of survival. However, this may only cause PCOS symptoms when the woman is chronically stressed, overeats, or is sedentary.</p>

<p>In other words, PCOS genes are inheritable, but having them doesn’t mean that you will be infertile. Later, we will find out how to turn fertility on (and PCOS off), but first, let’s figure out how PCOS happens.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">How Insulin Resistance Causes PCOS</span></h3>

    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
      <p>Earlier we found out that women with PCOS tend to have higher levels of insulin and insulin resistance. Elevated levels of insulin cause the ovaries to produce more androgens (like testosterone). Insulin also decreases the production of sex-hormone binding globulin — a glycoprotein that prevents testosterone from freely entering cells.</p>

<p>With more androgen production and less sex-hormone binding globulin, free testosterone can freely float through the blood and interact with cells. This can cause hair growth on the chest and face, mood swings, fatigue, low sex drive, acne, and other PCOS symptoms.</p>

<p>As androgen levels continue to increase, they stimulate 5-alpha reductase activity — an enzyme that converts testosterone to a more potent metabolite called dihydrotestosterone. This makes PCOS symptoms even worse.</p>

<p>Genetics can set the stage for this to happen, but PCOS will not progress without the presence of high insulin levels and insulin resistance. To create a chronic state of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, it takes a combination of poor lifestyle habits.</p>
